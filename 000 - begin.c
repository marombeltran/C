/* Preface
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is a reference manual for the C programming language as implemented by the GNU
 * Compiler Collection (GCC). Specifically, this manual aims to document:
 *      • The 1989 ANSI C standard, commonly known as “C89”
 *      • The 1999 ISO C standard, commonly known as “C99”, to the extent that C99 is
 *        implemented by GCC
 *      • The current state of GNU extensions to standard C
 * This manual describes C89 as its baseline. C99 features and GNU extensions are explicitly
 * labeled as such.
 *

 * By default, GCC will compile code as C89 plus GNU-specific extensions. Much of C99
 * is supported; once full support is available, the default compilation dialect will be C99
 * plus GNU-specific extensions. (Some of the GNU extensions to C89 ended up, sometimes
 * slightly modified, as standard language features in C99.)

 * The C language includes a set of preprocessor directives, which are used for things
 * such as macro text replacement, conditional compilation, and file inclusion. Although
 * normally described in a C language manual, the GNU C preprocessor has been thoroughly
 * documented in The C Preprocessor, a separate manual which covers preprocessing for C,
 * C++, and Objective-C programs, so it is not included here.
