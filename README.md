# The C Programming Language

Learning C language > notes

C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. 
By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, 
protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest 
supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. 

C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, with a static type system. 
It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, 
all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. 
A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating 
systems with few changes to its source code

Multi-paradigm: imperative (procedural), structured
