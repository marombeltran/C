    *
    * • Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values.
    *
    * • The type of an object determines the set of values it can have and what operations
    *   can be performed on it.
    *
    * • Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library rou-
    *   tines often use such names.
    *
    * • At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant.
    *
    * An expression consists of at least one operand and zero or more operators. Operands are
    * typed objects such as constants, variables, and function calls that return values.
    *
    * Innermost expressions are evaluated first.
