    *
    * • The C99 standard extends this range to include integer sizes of at least 64 bits.
    *
    * • You should use integer types for storing whole number values (and the char data 
    *   type for storing characters). The sizes and ranges listed for these types are minimums; 
    *   depending on your computer platform, these sizes and ranges may be larger.
